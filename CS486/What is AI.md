# What is AI
>[!important] The synthesis and analysis of computational agents that act intelligently
>An agent acts intelligently when
>* What it does is appropriate for its circumstances and its goals
>	* Taking into account that short-term and long-term consequences of its actions
>* It is flexible to changing environments and changing goals
>* It learns from experience
>* It makes appropriate choices given its perceptual and computational limitations

## Goals
**Scientific:** Understanding the principles that making intelligent behaviour possible in natural or artificial systems
* *analysis* of natural and artificial agents
* *testing hypotheses* about the construction of intelligent agents
* *building and experimenting with* intelligent agents
**Engineering:** Design and build useful intelligent artifacts
## History
* Turing Test
	* Imitation game
* SHRDLU
	* A program for Blocks World
* Game Playing
	* tic-tac-toe
	* Go
	* Chess
	* Checkers
	* StarCraft
* Robotics
	* Robocup (soccer)
	* Autonomous Cars
### Are Self-Driving Cars ( or Game Engines ) Intelligent?
Is it flexible enough?
Does it fit into human drivers?
