# Gradient

In multiple dimensions, the **[[Gradient]]** is the vector of partial derivatives along each dimension
The slope in any direction is the **dot product** of the direction with the gradient. The direction of steepest descent is the **negative gradient**
### Types of gradients
#### Numerical gradient
* approximate, slow, easy to write
* Calculate by finding slope for each value, add small value and see difference
#### Analytic gradient
* exact, fast, error-prone
* Use analytic expression to calculate gradient
