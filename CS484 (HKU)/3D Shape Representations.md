# 3D Shape Representations

## Depth Map
> [!tldr] For each pixel, depth map gives distance from the camera to the object in the world at the pixel
> * RGB + Depth image = RGB-D Image (2.5D)
> * This type of data can be recorded directly for some types of 3D sensors

### Predicting Depth Maps
Given an image, predict the depth map
*We can use a fully convolutional network*

> [!warning] Problem Scale / Depth Ambiguity
> A small, close object looks **exactly the same** as a larger, farther-away object
> * Absolute scale / depth are ambiguous from a single image

## Surface Normals
> [!tldr] For each pixel, surface normals give a vector giving the normal vector to the object in the world for that pixel

### Predicting Normals
Similar to depth maps
* Loss function is comparing angles between two vectors
![[Pasted image 20241206174058.png]]

##### Can predict depth map and normals with a single network

## Voxel Grid
![[Pasted image 20241206174430.png]]
* Represent a shape with a V x V x V grid of occupancies
* Just like a segmentation masks in [[Instance Segmentation#Mask R-CNN]], but in 3D
> [!success] Conceptually simple: just a 3D grid

> [!warning] Need high spatial resolution to capture fine structures
> Scaling to  high resolutions is nontrivial

### Processing Voxel Inputs: 3D Convolution
* Kernel is 3D cube sliding through input

### Generating Voxel Shapes: 3D Convolution

### Voxel Problems: Memory Usage

### Scaling Voxels: Oct-Trees

## Implicit Functions
Learn a function to classify arbitrary 3D points as inside / outside the shape

The surface of the 3D object is the level set {x: o(x) = 1/2}

## Point Cloud
![[Pasted image 20241206183519.png]]
* Represent shape as a set of P points in 3D space
* Requires new architecture, losses, etc
> [!success] Can represent fine structures without huge numbers of points

> [!warning] Doesnâ€™t explicitly represent the surface of the shape
> Extracting a mesh for rendering or other applications requires post-processing

### Processing Point Cloud Inputs: PointNet
Input: P points each with x, y, z positions
* Order of points should not matter
* Process pointclouds as set

## Mesh
### Triangle Mesh
![[Pasted image 20241206190502.png]]
Represent a 3D shape as a set of triangles
**Vertices:** Set of V points in 3D space
**Faces:** Set of triangles over the vertices
> [!success] Benefits
> * Standard representation of graphics
> * Explicitly represents 3D shapes
> * Adaptive
> 	* Can represent flat surfaces very efficiently
> 	* Can allocate more faces to areas with fine details
> * Can attach data on verts and interpolate over the whole surface
> 	* RGB colors, texture coordinates, normal vectors, etc

>[!warning] Problem
>Nontrivial to process with neural networks
