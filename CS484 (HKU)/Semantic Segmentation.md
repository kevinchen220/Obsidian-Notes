# Semantic Segmentation
> [!tldr] Label each pixel in the image with a category label
> Does not differentiate between different instances

## Sliding Window
For every pixel, create a small patch
â†’ Send patch to CNN to classify pixel

## Fully Convolutional Network
Design a network as a bunch of convolutional layers to make predictions for pixels all at once

> [!warning] Expensive!

>[!success] Design network as a bunch of convolutional layers, with **downsampling** and **upsampling** inside the network

### Upsampling (Unpooling)
#### Bed of Nails
Fill with 0s

#### Nearest Neighbor
Copy nearest neighbor
![[Pasted image 20241205132636.png]]
#### Bilinear Interpolation
Use two closest neighbors in x and y to construct linear approximations

#### Bicubic Interpolation
Use three closest neighbors in x and y to construct cubic approximations
* This is how we normally resize images!

#### Max Unpooling
Pair each max pooling layer with a max unpooling layer
* Remember which position had the max
* Place each max into remembered positions
* Fill rest with 0s

### Learnable Upsampling: Transposed Convolution
