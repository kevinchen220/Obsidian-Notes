## Supervised VS. Self-supervised Learning
### Supervised Learning
**Data:** (x, y)
* x is data, y is label
**Goal:** Learn a **function** to map x â†’ y
**Examples:** Classification, regression, objection detection, etc.

### Self-supervised Learning
**Data:** x
* Just data, no labels
**Goal:** Learn some underlying hidden structure of the data
**Examples:** Clustering, dimensionality reduction, feature learning, density estimation, etc.
