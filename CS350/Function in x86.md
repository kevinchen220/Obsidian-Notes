Functions are called with the `call` instruction
`call` pushes the return address on to the stack and jumps to the target

Simple functions may not need to save any registers

### Stack Frame
* Contains all the saved registers and local variables that must be saved within a function call
* Stack is made up of sequence of stack frames

### [[Execution Context]]
