# Types of flash memory
## [[NAND flash]]
Most prevalent
* Higher density
* Faster erase and write
* More errors internally
## NOR flash
* Faster reads in smaller data units
* Can execute straight out of NOR flash
* Significantly slower erases
## Single-level Cell vs. Multi-level Cell
* MLC encodes multiple bits in voltage level
	* SLC encodes one bit
	* Less margin of error
* MLC slower to write than SLC
* SLC cells longer longevity and performance
	* More expensive
