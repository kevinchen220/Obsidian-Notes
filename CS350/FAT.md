Can cached entire FAT so can be cheap compared to disk access

> [!Example] 
> Entry size = 16 bits
> * Whatâ€™s the maximum size of the FAT?
> 	* $2^16$ = 65536 entries
> * Given a 512 byte block, what is the maximum size of FS?
> 	* $2^16 \times 2^9=2^{25}$=32MiB

> * Where is root directory
> 	* Fixed location on disk
