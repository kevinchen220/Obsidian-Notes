# Scheduling Criteria

> [!tldr] Why do we care?
> What goals should we have for a scheduling problem?

### Throughput
The number of processes that complete per unit time
* Higher is better
### Turnaround time
Time for each process to complete
* Lower is better
### Response time
Time from request to first response
* Lower is better

**Above criteria are affected by secondary criteria**
#### CPU Utilization
Fraction of time CPU doing productive work
#### Waiting time
Time each process waits in ready queue
