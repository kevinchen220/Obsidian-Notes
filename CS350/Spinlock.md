### Implementation in CasterOS
```c
void Spinlock_Lock(Spinlock *lock)
{
	/* Disable Interrupts */
	Critical_Enter();
	while (atomic_swap_uint64(&lock->lock, 1) == 1)
	/* Spin! */;
	lock->cpu = CPU();
}
void Spinlock_Unlock(Spinlock *lock)
{
	ASSERT(lock->cpu == CPU());
	atomic_set_uint64(&lock->lock, 0);
	/* Re-enable Interrupts (if not spinlocks held) */
	Critical_Exit();
}
```
