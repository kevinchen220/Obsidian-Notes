# Keys
## Superkey
Given a relation $R$ with [[attributes]] $\{A_1, ..., A_k\}$ and subset $K$ of $R$, then $K$ is a **superkey** of $R$ if the FD $K→R$ holds on any instance of $R$
## Candidate Key
Given a relation $R$ with attributes $\{A_1, …, A_k\}$ and subset $K$ of $R$, then $K$ is a **candidate key** of $R$, and no strict subset of $K$ is a *superkey*
* Can’t remove any attribute from a candidate key and still have a superkey
## Primary Key
Given a relation $R$ with attributes $\{A_1, …, A_k\}$, the **primary key** of $R$ is a distinguished *candidate key* of $R$ chosen by the DBA group
