# Dependency Preserving

> [!tldr] No added complications in checking for violation of FDs in $F$

###### Let $R$ be a relational schema and $F$ a set of functional dependencies over $R$
Decomposition $D=\{R_1, â€¦, R_n\}$ of $R$ is dependency preserving if there is an equivalent set $G$ of functional dependencies, non of which is inter-relational in $D$
