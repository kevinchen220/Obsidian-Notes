# Normal Form

> [!tldr] No [[change anomalies]] in expressing data revision


> [!NOTE] Rule of Thumb
> Facts about different entities should be recorded in separate tables

Each relation schema should consist of two separate sets of attributes
1. Primary key to record facts that identify an entity
2. Record independent facts about the entity


> [!success] Goals
> * Intuitive and straightforward data revision that avoids anomalies
> * Non-redundant representation of data

## [[Boyce-Codd Normal Form]]
## [[Third Normal Form]]
## [[Minimal Cover]]
