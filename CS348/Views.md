# Views

> [!tip] Sometimes [[entity sets]] can be mapped to views instead of tables

## [[Specialization]]
An entity set E that is a specialization of one parent entity set and satisfies:
1. Only typing attributes declared
2. No foreign key constraints reference E
3. All entity sets that are specializations of E are mapped to views

**Need to add a new two-valued typing attribute `is-E`**
* Combine with Eâ€™s existing typing attributes to the parent entity set to enable a view definition for the mapping of E
