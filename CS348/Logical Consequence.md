# Logical Consequence
### [[Functional Dependencies|Functional Dependency]] Closure
Given a relation $R$ with attributes $\{A_1, ... , A_k\}$ and a set $F \cup \{X→Y\}$ of functional dependencies over $R$
$F$ logically implies $X→Y$ whenever $X→Y$ holds in all instances of $R$ that satisfies each FD in $F$
