# The Valuation Principle
## Cost-Benefit Analysis
#### Quantifying Costs and Benefits
* Any decision in which the value of the benefits exceeds the costs will increase the value of the firm
* **To compare the costs and benefits, we first need to convert them to a common unit**
## Market Prices and the Valuation Principle
#### Role of Competitive Markets
* A competitive market is one in which a good can be bought and sold at the same price
* In a competitive market, the price determines the value of the good
#### Valuation Principle
* The value of a commodity or an asset to the firm or its investors is determined by its competitive market price
* The benefits and costs of a decision should be evaluated using those market prices
* When the value of the benefits exceeds the value of the costs, the decision will increase the market value of the firm
#### Law of One Price
* In competitive markets, the same goods must have the same price
#### Arbitrage
* The practice of buying and selling equivalent goods in different markets to take advantage of a price difference
##### Arbitrage opportunity
* Any situation in which it is possible to make a profit without taking any risk or making any investment
##### Principle of No Arbitrage
* In normal competitive markets, supply and demand forces cause prices to adjust so that arbitrage opportunities are eliminated

## Valuing Cash Flows at Different Points in Time
#### Rule 1: Comparing and Combining Values
* It is only possible to compare or combine values at the same point in time
#### Rule 2: Compounding
* To calculate a cash flowâ€™s future value, you must compound it
##### Compound Interest
* The combination of earning interest on the original principle and earning interst on accrued interest
$$FV_n = C_0 \times (1+r)^n$$
#### Rule 3: Discounting
* To calculate the value of a future cash flow at an earlier point in time, we must discount it
$$PV_0 = \frac{C_n}{(1+r)^n}$$
