# Interest Rates
>[!tldr] Interest rates are the price of using money

## Effective Annual Rate (EAR)
The total amount of interest that will be earned at the end of one year expressed as a proportion of the amount invested at the beginning of the year
#### Adjusting the EAR to an Effective Rate over Different Time Periods
In general, by raising the interest rate factor $(1+r)$ to the appropriate power, we can compute an equivalent effective interest rate for a longer time period
* $(1+r)^{0.5} = 1.0247$, so a 5% EAR is equivalent to an interest rate of 2.47% earned every six months
* Equivalent $n$-Period Effective Rate = $(1+r)^n-1$

## Annual Percentage Rates (APR)
Indicates the amount of **simple interest** earned in one year **without** the effect of compounding
* Interest earned only on the original principal amount without considering compounding of interest or interest earned on accrued interest
$$\text{Interest Rate per Compouding Period} = \frac{APR}{m}$$
#### Converting an APR to an EAR
$$1+EAR = (1 + \frac{APR}{m})^m$$
## Formation and Importance of Interest Rates
### The Determinants of Interest Rates
#### Inflation and Real versus Nominal Rates
**Nominal Interest Rates**
* Interest rates quoted by banks and other financial institutions that indicate the rate at which money will grow if invested for a certain period of time.
**Real Interest Rate**
* The rate of growth of purchasing power after adjusting for inflation
#### Investment and Interest Rate Policy
* When the costs of an investment precede the benefits, an increase in the interest rate will decrease the net value created by an investment.
#### The Yield Curve and Interest Rates
**Term Structure:** The relationship between the investment term and the interest rate
**Yield Curve:** A plot of bond yields as a function of the bonds’ maturity date
**Risk-Free Interest Rate:** The interest rate at which money can be borrowed or lent without risk over a given period
#### Interest Rate Determination
The Bank of Canada determines very short-term interest rates through its influence on the **overnight rate**
* The rate at which banks can borrow cash reserves on an overnight basis from the Bank of Canada

1. If interest rates are expected to rise → long-term interest rates will tend to be higher than short-term rates to attract investors
2. If interest rates are expected to fall, long-term rates will tend to be lower than short-term rates to attract borrowers

**Steep**
* Long-term rates are much higher than short-term rates
**Inverted**
* Long–term rates are lower than short-term rates
