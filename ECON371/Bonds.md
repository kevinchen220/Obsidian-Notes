# Bonds
## Bond Terminology
#### Bond Indenture
* A statement of the terms of a bond as well as the amounts and dates of all payments to be made
#### Maturity Date
* The final repayment date of a bond
#### Term
* The time remaining until the final repayment date of a bond
#### Face Value
* AKA par value or principal amount
* Notional amount used to compute interest payments
#### Coupons
* The promised interest payments of a bond
* Paid periodically until the maturity date of the bond
#### Coupon Rate
* Set by the issuer and stated on the bond certificate
* By convention, expressed as an APR, so the amount of each coupon payment, CPN, is 
$$CPN = \frac{\text{Coupon Rate}\times \text{Face Value}}{\text{Number of Coupon Payments per Year}}$$

## Zero-Coupon Bonds
Only two cash flows
* The bond’s market price at the time of purchase
* The bond’s face value at maturity
Treasury bills are zero-coupon government bonds with maturity of up to one year
#### Risk-Free Interest Rates
A default-free zero-coupon bond that matures on date $n$ provides a risk-free return over the same period
* Law of One Price guarantees that the risk-free interest rate equals the yield to maturity on such a bond
* Refer to the YTM of such bond as risk-free interest rate
#### Spot Interest Rates
Default-free, zero-coupon yields

## Coupon Bonds
* Pay face value at maturity
* Also make regular coupon interest payments
Return on a coupon bond comes from:
* Any difference between the purchase price and the face value
* Periodic coupon payments
#### YTM of a Coupon Bond
* The coupon payments represent an annuity, so the yield to maturity is the interest rate $YTM_n$ that equates the bond’s price, $P$, to the present value of an annuity of coupons plus the present value of the bond’s face value, FV:

## Why Bond Prices Change
* Zero-coupon bonds always trade for a discount
* Coupon bonds may trade at a discount or at a premium
* Most issuers of coupon bonds choose a coupon rate so that the bonds will initially trade at, or very close to, par
* After the issue date, the market price of  a bond changes over time
#### Interest Rate Changes and Bond Prices
* If a bond sells at par, the only return investors will earn is from the coupons that the bond pays
	* The bond’s coupon rate will exactly equal its yield to maturity
* As interest rates in the economy fluctuate, the yields that investors demand will also change
* **Longer term bonds are more sensitive to interest rate changes**
	* More risky
* **Bond with smaller coupon payments is more sensitive to interest rate changes**
	* More risky
#### Key Terms
**Premium:**
* A price at which coupon bonds trade that is greater than their face value
**Discount:**
* A price at which coupon bonds trade that is lower than their face value
**Par:**
* A price at which coupon bonds trade that is equal to their face value
> [!tldr] Determining the Discount or Premium of a Coupon Bond
> * When the coupon rate of the bond is higher than its YTM, it trades at a premium
> * When its coupon rate equals its YTM, it trades at par
> * When its coupon rate is lower than its YTM, it trades at a discount

## Corporate Bonds
#### Credit Risk
* The risk of default by the issuer of any bond that is not default free
	* Indication that the bond’s cash flows are not known with certainty
* Corporations with higher default risk will need to pay higher coupons to attract buyers to their bonds
#### Corporate Bond Yields
* Yield to maturity of a defaultable bond is not equal to the expected return of investing in the bond
* A higher yield to maturity does not necessarily imply that a bond’s expected return is higher
#### Bond Ratings
Several companies rate the creditworthiness of bonds
1. Investment-grade bonds
2. Speculative bonds
	1. Junk bonds
	2. High-yield bonds
* The rating depends on 
	* The risk of bankruptcy
	* Bondholders’ claim to assets in the event of bankruptcy
#### Corporate and Provincial Yield Curves
The credit spread is the difference between the various bonds and the Government of Canada
> [!important] To provide a higher YTM, the purchase price for the debt must be lower
